# Lil_Care

This final year Bachelorâ€™s degree project (third year) is a collaborative effort developed by a team of three authors. We designed and developed an integrated web system dedicated to managing registrations, attendance monitoring, schedule organization, and facilitating effective communication with parents in nurseries.

The project is built using modern technologies including Next.js, Supabase, Microsoft Azure, and Chargily for payment integration.
